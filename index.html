<P>LUMBERJACK: Tyler boasts his material wealth and addresses his haters over an abrasive beat that contrasts much of his more melodic production. The song’s instrumental heavily samples the August 1994 Gravediggaz cut “2 Cups of Blood.”</P>

<P>MANIFESTO: Throughout the song, he raps about his controversial past, how he refuses to conform to the standards other people want to hold him against, and how social media platforms like Twitter have changed to become a hub for social activism. In a way this is Tyler, The Creator’s response to cancel culture.</P>

<P>MOMMA TALK: This song is exactly as the title suggests – a voice memo of Tyler, The Creator's mother talking.</P>

<P>WILLSHIRE: Recorded in a single take, “WILSHIRE” sees Tyler tell the story of a failed relationship—from the point of him and his partner first laying eyes upon each other to their eventual breakup.</P>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3yxh6Av2dL0rC99Iz2xZps?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<P>WHAT A DAY: Tyler reflects on the constant demands on his time and energy, feeling overwhelmed and overworked.</P>

He's not shy about his wealth and ambition, bragging about buying his neighbor's house and turning it into a yard. Tyler's all about loyalty to his people too. He mentions his grandma Lynda, whom he loved and lost in 2013, and says that if you don't know her name, you're not close to him.</P>
