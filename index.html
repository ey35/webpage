<!-- Wolf -->
<h2>Wolf</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2JZpS2sOdJy37oBpn1GuPW?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: The keys and breathy intro suggest Tyler has gone soft, but as the cooing of “you” fades out, Tyler says an emphatic “fuck” to turn it into a graceful “Fuck You.” The track sets up the return of the character “Sam,” who addresses his demons and defies the “Wolf.” It’s of course a true Tyler intro, especially leading into a slight rant at the end.</p>

<!-- Jamba feat. Hodgy Beats -->
<h2>Jamba feat. Hodgy Beats</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3Z5pXxCb0O6L53vejFHhqQ?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: While the crux of “Jamba” is supposed to be playful, Tyler’s entry speaks otherwise. “Papa ain’t call even though he saw me on T.V.” he says before asking for his inhaler as he goes into detail about smoking weed. That is until Domo shuts it down at the end (Tyler is admittedly straight edge). Tyler’s introductory daddy issues slightly feel out of place, especially with Hodgy’s follow-up verse. However, it sets the stage for the rest of the project.</p>

<!-- Cowboy -->
<h2>Cowboy</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2hjjUjikOa29kImnI5kQPw?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: More darkness to the tune of a playfully simple beat. “Ain’t been this sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up,” merely scratches the surface. Tyler has some demons and he isn’t afraid to show it: “You’d think all this money would make a happy me, but I’m ’bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat.” Where Tyler previously had scorn for his life on the brink of success, it seems like he detests his new life even more.</p>

<!-- Awkward feat. Frank Ocean -->
<h2>Awkward feat. Frank Ocean</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6c7l5gpEyCNGr86jsWneGy?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: Tyler encapsulates the awkwardness of young love through chopped and screwed rhymes about his youth. It wasn’t all that long ago, yet he’s speaking about it like it’s a distant memory. The message gets drowned out by the track sounding like it’s sitting underwater, yet you can still make out a Frank Ocean cameo at the end.</p>

<!-- Domo23 -->
<h2>Domo23</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/75kiQfmmuQwgquZ9RLSvuA?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: Tyler runs the gamut of smack talk, starting with calling his manager Christian Clancy a slave master. He goes into the rumors of homophobia, talks about smoking sherm with Justin Bieber, after reminding everyone that he became rich off eating a cockroach in his “Yonkers” video. “Domo23” is made to be offensive but arrives in the least offensive manner. One Direction might not be too pleased by their mention though.</p>

<!-- Answer feat. Syd the Kid -->
<h2>Answer feat. Syd the Kid</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5wTpnBRTx1HSGQVDZQ2VSh?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: There’s an obvious vulnerability to this track. Tyler is addressing his father (a common thread in “Wolf”) to the tune of simple guitars and percussion, bragging about his success but then returning to theme that if he ever calls his father, he hopes he answers. It’s bipolar and angry (like Tyler most of the time), yet proves he has some real feelings to work out. He then turns it on his friends and points out their problems. Welcome to Tyler’s black leather couch.</p>

<!-- Slater feat. Frank Ocean -->
<h2>Slater feat. Frank Ocean</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2wK7y55bzry7tUDmDqYaz7?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: We don’t really learn that “Slater” is a bicycle until the very end when Frank Ocean declares, “Oh my God, I guess you’re a cool guy. You’re talking to a fucking bike. Loser.” The track is more or less a mumbled stream of consciousness, sticking to the self-deprecation, but still knocking “Wolf” off its path a bit.</p>

<!-- 48 feat. Nas & Frank Ocean -->
<h2>48 feat. Nas & Frank Ocean</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5AnVuHLmgipXkFmBvj2Q6H?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: It’s weird hearing Tyler insert social commentary into his formula. Nas’ sermon about crack at the start and the close of the song is out of place, plus Tyler’s sincerity is debatable. Here’s a guy who would punch a puppy and now he’s launching a D.A.R.E. campaign? He even takes the blame for the drugs. Hopefully he’s using drugs as a euphemism for music, because taken literally would be totally questionable.</p>

<!-- Colossus -->
<h2>Colossus</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/04QTBqa3IA4ZAKEuqRPzEH?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: Picture Eminem’s “The Way I Am” mixed with “Stan” on emotional steroids. A few minor instruments (including what might be a triangle) only accent Tyler’s message about an obsessed fan. Tyler continuously switches the lyrics from being cutesy fanfare to sexually maniacal. It’s demented, yet Tyler gets his point across. Fans or no fans, he’s dying to lead a normal life.</p>

<!-- PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer feat. Laetitia Sadier and Frank Ocean -->
<h2>PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer feat. Laetitia Sadier and Frank Ocean</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0NjW4SKY3gbfl2orl1p8hr?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: The three songs melding into one are a little confusing, though the changes in production signify the start/finish of each vignette. Tyler is a great storyteller when he wants to be. And when he isn’t dropping F-bombs (the three and the four letter kind), he can be charming. He doesn’t let that last for too long before bringing the silliness again. All of that takes a backseat to a cameo from Stereolab’s Laetitia Sadier.</p>

<!-- IFHY feat. Pharrell -->
<h2>IFHY feat. Pharrell</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5L4n81Ecf8UE837uJkuoJJ?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: The hook says it all: “I fucking hate you, but I love you. I’m bad at keeping my emotions bubbled.” The destructive beat sets the stage for another round of bipolarism, as Tyler confesses his undying love for a girl (Salem) before turning around and slapping her with words. Pharrell’s cameo (like most of the appearances on the project) isn’t overt, yet it’s the perfect closer for the track.</p>

<!-- Pigs -->
<h2>Pigs</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1UBLglX9fPtTBZSwJj4yVG?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: Despite being in his ’20s, this track is full of teen angst. Tyler calls his inhaler his best friend (because it won’t let him cough) and brings his depression to the surface. By the second verse though, he takes revenge on his bullies and through police sirens, suggests he resorted to violence. Given the United States’ history with situations like Columbine, Virginia Tech, and most recently Sandy Hook, this track comes in poor taste. Then again, when did Tyler ever care about being tasteful?</p>

<!-- Parking Lot feat. Casey Veggies and Mike G -->
<h2>Parking Lot feat. Casey Veggies and Mike G</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4oQkcfukOHfKsmeoeXQLWC?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: Casey Veggies’ appearance solely on the hook is disappointing, given how grating Tyler’s vocals can be at times. That’s probably what Mike G is there for, but his verse is shorter than what feels like Tyler’s twelve. “Wolf” is almost too long, and by the 13th track the work begins to drag. Subtractions of prior cuts would make this track sound even better than perhaps it does when played in consecutive order.</p>

<!-- Rusty feat. Domo Genesis and Earl Sweatshirt -->
<h2>Rusty feat. Domo Genesis and Earl Sweatshirt</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2OaPyH3JLuft6iuNFHFJl0?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: Over vibrating chords, Domo Genesis, Tyler, and Earl Sweatshirt host a strenuous lyrical exercise. Of course Tyler’s verse is the longest, but he loses to Earl’s cleanup bars. By the end of the track it’s the return of Sam revisiting the Wolf and condemning him. But the overuse of the “other” F-word is a bit much at this point, and the story loses to unnecessary slurs.</p>

<!-- Trashwang feat. Na’kel, Jasper, Lucas, L-Boy, Taco, Left Brain & Lee Spielman -->
<h2>Trashwang feat. Na’kel, Jasper, Lucas, L-Boy, Taco, Left Brain & Lee Spielman</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2vLwhcsvRd1f2ETft1kWDN?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: “I want the black kids to like me for this one,” Tyler says on what is perhaps the closest to Trap Rap that he’s ever come. It’s less about the content and more about the string production with gunshots that host a noticeable change in Tyler’s cadence. He speeds up his flow considerably in parts, showing his dexterity. He should do more of this, because even in the midst of his posse attempting to sound like Waka Flocka Flame, Tyler still shines.</p>

<!-- Treehome95 feat. Coco O & Erykah Badu -->
<h2>Treehome95 feat. Coco O & Erykah Badu</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/60b6B2ULC85t4Y5IjZvP7A?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: This jazzy cut doesn’t belong on “Wolf” and neither does the Erykah Badu cameo. That being said, “Treehome95” is beautiful post neo-soul/hip-hop. It feels though as if Tyler was too intimidated to contribute in the presence of FatBellyBella. He sings on the track for 30 seconds before leaving the rest up to Coco O and Badu. Sounds like he was hushed by mama’s gun.</p>

<!-- Tamale -->
<h2>Tamale</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6oVFpdtDzSgRLv8rUgFVUW?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: The tinny production on “Tamale” is almost as crass as Tyler’s bars about getting fellated by someone’s little sister. He was clearly reading from the Bible of Lil Wayne before laying the bars down on this track. This is a prime example of how in some instances on “Wolf,” Tyler maturely comes to grips with his own personal demons and in other moments wants to still be the perverted kid at the mall.</p>

<!-- Lone -->
<h2>Lone</h2>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2OaPyH3JLuft6iuNFHFJl0?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<p>Description: This is the moment where the entire story comes together with another therapy session. Tyler is the Wolf, and this cast of characters throughout his trilogy has all contributed to his ups and downs that he attributes to the loss of his grandmother. It’s a dense story – one that had you not been following along for four years you might miss. Still, it’s one hell of a saga that’s worth revisiting, and “Lone” is the perfect conclusion.</p>

              <p>SIR BAUDELAIRE: “SIR BAUDELAIRE,” the intro to Tyler, The Creator’s seventh studio album, introduces us to Tyler Baudelaire, the character Tyler assumes on CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST. Both Tyler himself and the album’s narrator, DJ Drama, refer to Tyler by the name throughout the record.</p>

                <p>CORSO: “CORSO” is the introduction to the plot that we will later go through as the album progresses. Tyler has done this on multiple occasion in his discography such as “WOLF” from Wolf, in which we are introduced rather abruptly to the characters whose story will play out over the course of the album.“CORSO” is the introduction to the plot that we will later go through as the album progresses.

                <P>LEMONHEAD: The track features Tyler, 42 Dugg, and Frank Ocean showing their bravado by flaunting one another’s opulence and expensive possessions.</P>

<P>WUSYANAME: “WUSYANAME” portrays Tyler, The Creator falling madly in love with a woman he just met, shortly before finding out that she's taken.</P>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6cFamI2vPztQoopGMnjD64?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<P>LUMBERJACK: Tyler boasts his material wealth and addresses his haters over an abrasive beat that contrasts much of his more melodic production. The song’s instrumental heavily samples the August 1994 Gravediggaz cut “2 Cups of Blood.”</P>
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6kz3FLaVhtcUECyMYR9BCR?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<P>HOT WIND BLOWS: The chorus references the harsh wind conditions, but they remain unfazed and enjoy the view of the mountains from the lake</P>

<p>MASSA: On “MASSA” Tyler calls back to the era of slavery in the United States which took place from its founding in 1776 until 1865.</p>
                <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0lXJL0unztXDdIOXu5xCML?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<P>RUNITUP: In “RUNITUP,” Tyler is discussing the common theme of CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST–success–in light of the past situations that preceded it. </P>

<P>MANIFESTO: Throughout the song, he raps about his controversial past, how he refuses to conform to the standards other people want to hold him against, and how social media platforms like Twitter have changed to become a hub for social activism. In a way this is Tyler, The Creator’s response to cancel culture.</P>

<P>DOGTOOTH: "Dogtooth" is a song about Tyler's lust for a girl, his sense of superiority, and a warning to his rivals that they don't measure up. He's not shy about his wealth and ambition, bragging about buying his neighbor's house and turning it into a yard. Tyler's all about loyalty to his people too. He mentions his grandma Lynda, whom he loved and lost in 2013, and says that if you don't know her name, you're not close to him.</P>
